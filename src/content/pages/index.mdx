# Hey, I'm Kristian Freeman. 

## Thanks for stopping by.

I'm currently a Senior Developer Advocate at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). I get to teach developers how to build apps on the Cloudflare stack with video tutorials and starter kits. I'm probably best known to Cloudflare users as the host of our [Workers 101 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Qe96fqg1M).

Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com) and Simple (_simple.com_), building full-stack apps using React, TypeScript, GraphQL, lots and lots of databases, and Ruby on Rails.

I try to write here a few times a week about what I'm building and thinking about. I'm really into [web dev](/tags/webdev), [health and fitness](/tags/health), [personal finance](/tags/finance), and [building side projects](/tags/projects).
