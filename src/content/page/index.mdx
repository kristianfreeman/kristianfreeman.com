# Hey, I'm Kristian Freeman.

I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur. I work as [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) as a Senior Developer Advocate, teaching developers how to build apps. Check out my [Workers 101 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Qe96fqg1M) if you're interested!

I'm a builder. Here's what I'm working on:

- [Saturday Stuff](https://www.saturdaystuff.com), a biweekly tech newsletter with a few thousand subscribers
- [SMTX Life](https://smtxlife.com), a local newsletter for San Marcos, Texas
- [getfrontendjobs.com](https://getfrontendjobs.com), a job board for frontend developers

Previously I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com) and Simple, working with React, GraphQL, and Ruby on Rails.

I write about [web dev](/tags/webdev), [health and fitness](/tags/health), [personal finance](/tags/finance), and [building side projects](/tags/projects).
