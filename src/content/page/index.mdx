# Hey, I'm Kristian Freeman.

## Thanks for stopping by.

I'm currently a Senior Developer Advocate at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). I teach developers how to build apps on Cloudflare. I'm probably best known as the host of our [Workers 101 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Qe96fqg1M).

I'm an entrepeneur and builder. I'm currently building a stealth crypto project (~$18k MRR) and [getfrontendjobs.com](https://getfrontendjobs.com). I work on side projects under the banner of [Freeman Labs](https://freemanlabstx.com), a Texas-based holding company and consultancy.

Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com) and Simple (_simple.com_), building full-stack apps using React, GraphQL, and Ruby on Rails.

On this site, I write on topics like [web dev](/tags/webdev), [health and fitness](/tags/health), [personal finance](/tags/finance), and [building side projects](/tags/projects).
