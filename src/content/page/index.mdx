# Hey, I'm Kristian Freeman.

## Thanks for stopping by.

I'm currently a Senior Developer Advocate at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). I teach developers how to build apps on Cloudflare. I'm probably best known as the host of our [Workers 101 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Qe96fqg1M).

I write the newsletter [Saturday Stuff](https://www.saturdaystuff.com) - the newsletter for developers who are secretly curious about everything. It's sent out every other Saturday to over 3,000 developers and tech professionals.

I'm an entrepeneur and builder. I'm currently building a stealth crypto project (~$10k MRR) and [getfrontendjobs.com](https://getfrontendjobs.com). I work on side projects under the banner of [Freeman Labs](https://freemanlabstx.com), a Texas-based holding company and consultancy.

Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com) and Simple (_simple.com_), building full-stack apps using React, GraphQL, and Ruby on Rails.

On this site, I write on topics like [web dev](/tags/webdev), [health and fitness](/tags/health), [personal finance](/tags/finance), and [building side projects](/tags/projects).
