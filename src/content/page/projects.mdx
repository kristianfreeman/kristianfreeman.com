# Projects

I work as [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) as a Senior Developer Advocate during the day.

Mornings, evenings, weekends (ðŸ˜“) - I use code to build profitable businesses and apps. Here's what I'm working on:

- [Stars and Scrubs](https://cleaningsanmarcos.com), a home services company based in San Marcos, Texas
- [SMTX Life](https://smtxlife.com), a local newsletter for San Marcos
- [Saturday Stuff](https://www.saturdaystuff.com), a biweekly tech newsletter with a few thousand subscribers
- [getfrontendjobs.com](https://getfrontendjobs.com), a job board for frontend developers

You can also read all my posts tagged ["projects"](/tags/projects) to see breakdowns of what I'm working on.
