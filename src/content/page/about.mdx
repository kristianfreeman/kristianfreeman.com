# About Me

I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur. I work as [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) as a Senior Developer Advocate, teaching developers how to build apps. Check out my [Workers 101 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Qe96fqg1M) if you're interested!

Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com) and simple.com, working with React, GraphQL, and Ruby on Rails.
