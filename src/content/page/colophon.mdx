# About this site

## This site is coded and written by Kristian Freeman.

The code for this website is open-source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/kristianfreeman/kristianfreeman.com).

It's built on top of [Astro](https://astro.build), and deployed to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). Cloudflare is used extensively for improving page load and performance.

The UI is custom, built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The site uses Vercel's [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font family - Geist Sans for text and Geist Mono for code. [Expressive Code](https://expressivecode.com) is used for syntax highlighting, code folding, and other features.

I still use Vim :) My computer (all of them, in fact) are managed with [Nix](https://github.com/kristianfreeman/computer). I use [Zellij](/quick-review-of-zellij) as my terminal multiplexer.
