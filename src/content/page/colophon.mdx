# About this site

## This site is built and written by Kristian Freeman.

The code for this website is open-source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/kristianfreeman/kristianfreeman.com).

It's built on top of [Astro](https://astro.build), and deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). I use Cloudflare extensively for improving page load and performance.[^1]

The UI is custom, built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

The bulk of the site is typed in [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible), with [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) for code.

I use Neovim + [my personal config](https://github.com/kristianfreeman/nvim).

[^1]: I work at Cloudflare - so I'm a bit biased!
