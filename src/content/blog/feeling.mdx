The short version: [**Feeling**](https://feeling.kristianfreeman.com/), my app for keeping a record of your feelings over time, is now [on the iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feeling-how-are-you-feeling/id841589028?ls=1&mt=8)..

I've been a believer of quantified self tools in a long time, but find them to be horrendously complicated. Feeling is an attempt to distill my interest in quantifying my life at the base level: *rate it one to five*.

It turns out that doing that is surprisingly easy. For all the stress, happiness and everything in-between that happens can be distilled down into a number. Maybe that's depressing; the reality is that most days, on their own, are quite simple.

If that's not enough, you can add pictures and notes too! Hurrah.

I have a ton of stuff I'm trying to wrap out right now, so the part of this post that isn't being included is the technical bits that make this work, as well as the process behind it. That'll come soon, as well as a bit of a post-mortem on the process, design, and development of the app. I was going to include a video for the project generated with [gource](https://code.google.com/p/gource/); however, I realized half-way through that my relative inexperience with Obj-C and Xcode led to less than optimal Git usage. There's not a ton of commits, even between build versions, and actual updates. Now that it's out and a bit more solidified, that'll change.

The process to the App Store was a little insane - it got rejected for a fairly stupid reason. Here's the story, condensed on Twitter yesterday.

```

Regardless, I submitted an appeal to the App Review Board and went out to the lake.

When I came back, an email told me that I had a response in the "Resolution Center", which is basically a conversation thread between you and the reviewer of the app. I had another email that told me Feeling was "Processing for App Store". Five minutes later, and it was in! Unfortunately, since the app had been approved, I didn't get a chance to see the response to my message to the reviewer. Looking back, I think I might've been a little angry and should've written something a bit calmer.

...here's what I wrote, either way. :)

Go check out Feeling if you're interested. Reviews are nice, but bad reviews are nice if you find bugs too. Thanks!
