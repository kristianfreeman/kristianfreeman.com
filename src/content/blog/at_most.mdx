*tl;dr: `at_most` is a Ruby gem for limiting the number of AR model instances in your Rails apps*

I've found that if I'm repeating a use-case or functionality over multiple apps, it's probably worth extracting into a reusable gem. So in that vein, I've released [at_most](https://github.com/imkmf/at_most), an easy way to limit your ActiveRecord model instances.

The primary function I've been using this for is limiting the number of users for an app. If you're using something like [ActiveAdmin](https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin) for managing your models, it's nice to limit the number of `AdminUsers` for safety's sake.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  at_most(5)
end
```

It's really that simple. We can test this functionality by creating five users, and then attempting to create a sixth:

```ruby
>> 5.times do User.create!; end
```

```ruby
>> User.create!
=> ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: The maximum number of users has been reached.
```

It's important to note that this is a validation error -- we can override this with our own custom error message fairly easily.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  at_most(5, { message: "Sorry, all our spots are full!" })
end
```

We can also use i18n to set an error message at a *per model* and *global* level:

```yaml
en:
  activerecord:
    errors:
      models:
        users:
          at_most: "All of our spots are full :(:("
        books:
          at_most: "I can't read all of these!"
  at_most: "Something went terribly wrong."
```

This was a good chance for me to dig into how validations work a bit, and understand the proper way to add to them. As always, PRs and tickets are appreciated.

You can find `at_most` on Github [here](https://github.com/imkmf/at_most).
