I've seen a lot of posts on rooting the HTC One M8, but everything is either on Windows or assumes a fairly non-technical background.

This guide is for *OS X* and people who aren't scared to open up a command prompt.

Prerequisites:

1. You'll need an account at [HTCdev](http://www.htcdev.com/).
2. Enable USB debugging and disable "Fast boot" on the One.
3. Install the Android SDK using Homebrew: `brew install android-sdk`. Not yo'll want to add the platform tools to your `$PATH` as well.
4. Install HTC Sync Manager to get the device drivers. Note that every time you plug in the One to your computer, the "HTC Sync Manager" volume it mounts will have a link to those tools.
