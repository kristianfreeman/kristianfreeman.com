[HTTPS] is a **Good Ideaâ„¢**. Without getting too political, today's date
(September 11, 2013 at time of writing) is a day of rememberance, but also
a day of realization. Things have gotten pretty damn bad in the United States
of America, in terms of internet security and personal privacy. While it might
be a bit naive to draw a straight line from 9/11 to our concerns of today,
there is a definite progression.

Thus, I thought I'd take a bit of time today to secure my website for both
readers and myself. HTTPS certificates have a reputation for being somewhat
expensive, and complicated. Complicated doesn't bother me, but expensive does
-- this site is incredibly cheap to run and I'd rather not hike up the costs
for something that has relatively low traffic.

I came across a post today via Twitter that seems like a good solution:
["Switch To HTTPS Now, For Free"][forfree]. It seems as though a company called
[StartSSL](https://www.startssl.com/) offers free SSL certificates, and even
has a guide to setting them up. I found their guide to be pretty
self-explanatory: you have to verify your email, your domain, and then you
proceed with creating your SSL certificate.

The article linked above does a better job of explaining this process than
I am, and there's no need for me to repeat it. Follow the article (I like the
command-line DIY version) and you'll be there in minutes.

I did run into one problem; namely, an error resembling
`PEM_read_bio:bad end line`. There's a solution for this. If you follow the
article and `cat` your certificates together, there's a good chance that the
first two will concatenate with the `BEGIN` and `END` blocks on a single line.

```
-----END CERTIFICATE----------BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
```

The solution is simple: count five hyphens in from `END CERTIFICATE` and
separate them:

```
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
```

Otherwise, the guide is great. This site is now running HTTPS, and everyone is
all the better for it.
