I'm in on [Astro](https://astro.build). I haven't quite figured out every little detail of it, but it feels comprehensive enough that I'm ready to invest more time and energy into it being the new way that I deploy full-stack JS apps.

## Overview

Here's how I deploy Astro apps to Cloudflare:

1. Create a new Astro app (`npm create astro`)
2. Add the Cloudflare config (`npx astro add cloudflare`). This installs the `@astrojs/cloudflare` package.
3. Ensure `astro.config.mjs` looks like the below code sample. The snippet makes some assumptions that I'll explain shortly.
4. Create `wrangler.toml` and configure it as seen below.
5. Install `@cloudflare/workers-types` and reference it in `tsconfig.json`.

## Files

**`astro.config.mjs`:**

```ts
// @ts-check
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import cloudflare from '@astrojs/cloudflare';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'server',
  adapter: cloudflare({
    imageService: "passthrough",
    platformProxy: {
      enabled: true,
    },
  }),
});
```

**`src/env.d.ts`**:

```typescript
/// <reference path="../.astro/types.d.ts" />
type Runtime = import('@astrojs/cloudflare').Runtime<Env>;
declare namespace App {
  interface Locals extends Runtime { }
}
```

**`tsconfig.json`** (add this line to your full config):

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@cloudflare/workers-types"],
  },
}
```

**`wrangler.toml`**:

```toml
name = "appname"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-25"
pages_build_output_dir = "dist"
```

## How your app works

What assumptions/decisions this makes:

1. Full-stack apps

The `output: 'server'` line in the Astro config makes it so that Astro generates server-side rendering code so that Cloudflare runs the app on the edge. This allows you to write functions that have full access to requests. 

If you want a static app – no dynamic code or functions – you can change the `output` line. But it's probably worth it just to keep it as `server` since CF supports it, in case you need a dynamic function/page at some point.

2. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

Candidly, the CF Pages/Workers story is a bit confusing right now.[^1] The way that Cloudflare handles deploys with wrangler leads to this deployment strategy. Simply put – `astro build` will build to `dist` with this config, and the `pages_build_output_dir` directive in `wrangler.toml` will upload the directory and use it as the Cloudflare Pages deployment.

If the story [continues to change](https://blog.cloudflare.com/builder-day-2024-announcements/) with Cloudflare Pages, it may be that the app technically gets deployed to _Workers_ instead of _Pages_, but for now, this solution is just fine. I'll revisit this if needed.

3. Use `platformProxy` and write platform-specific functions

With the `platformProxy` configuration enabled in `astro.config.mjs`, you can use Astro's built-in commands to do most of your day-to-day development. `astro dev` will wrap around `wrangler pages dev` with full support for Cloudflare bindings, local/remote development, etc. `package.json` scripts looks like:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "wrangler types && astro dev",
    "deploy": "npm run build && wrangler pages deploy",
  }
}
```

With everything configured correctly, all your JS stuff on the frontend should work as you'd expect. On the "backend", functions are really powerful. File-based routing, you get full access to bindings, and you write full-stack functions to handle requests and return responses:

```ts
// src/pages/api/example.ts
export async function PUT({ locals, request }) {
  // Get access to env bindings
  const { env } = locals.runtime;
  // Do stuff
  return new Response("OK")
}
```

## Conclusion

I'll update this as needed, as I continue to build with Astro. But so far, I'm impressed. I invested a lot of time into Gatsby to learn how to build full-stack apps on it. Astro seems like a more robust solution to a lot of the issues that I ran into with more complex applications on Gatsby.
