[Last week, I shared what I’ve been working on recently](/freecodecamp-basic-html-certification/) — an up-to-date “codethrough” of freeCodeCamp’s curriculum: walking through _every_ exercise, lesson, and challenge, and adding my own spin on it where possible.

I also shared the first video in the series, covering the basics of HTML, including tags, attributes, and basic input handling.

**Today, I’m releasing episode two: almost ninety minutes covering the basics of CSS, covering [freeCodeCamp’s “Basic CSS” module in their Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/).**

**Instead, here’s a quick glance at the important stuff you’ll learn:**

- Using CSS classes and IDs to target HTML elements
- Importing and working with custom Google Fonts
- How to use padding and margin to space and position elements
- The clockwise notation as a way to always remember how to correctly set padding and margin, in order — this was new to me! 🤯
- CSS colors, and how to set them using hex codes and the RGB format
- Defining and using CSS variables for more re-usable CSS code
- How to use media queries to style your HTML based on screen size, width, and more

That’s just a quick glance — there’s about 45 exercises and lessons in total — and whether you’re new to CSS, scared to jump in, or an expert who could use some quick exercises as a little morale boost, you should check out the video and let me know what you learn!
