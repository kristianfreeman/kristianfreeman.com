I've been reading ["Metaprogramming Ruby"](http://pragprog.com/book/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby) the last couple days, and realizing that a lot of what makes [Rspec](http://rspec.info) amazing is its usage of metaprogramming. I thought it would be interesting to try and write my own test framework.

Surprisingly, it only took a couple minutes to write something quite powerful. [`freeman`](https://github.com/imkmf/freeman) is the gem that I produced.

It's very simple - it extends the `Object` class to add methods for `#is` and `isnt`, and the `Kernel` class for a `test` method.

```ruby
test "one plus one is two" do
  (1 + 1).is 2
end

test "one plus two isnt one" do
  (1 + 2).isnt 1
end
```

Each test creates a `Struct`, which takes the name of the test and the `do..end` block (the code itself), and evaluates it as `true` or `false`. This is what is a test is, after all!

Here's the definition of `should` in Rspec:

```ruby
def should(matcher=nil, message=nil)
  RSpec::Expectations::PositiveExpectationHandler.handle_matcher(subject, matcher, message)
end
```

And the definition of `RSpec::Expectations::PositiveExpectationHandler`:

```ruby
class PositiveExpectationHandler < ExpectationHandler

  def self.handle_matcher(actual, matcher, message=nil, &block)
    check_message(message)
    ::RSpec::Matchers.last_should = :should
    ::RSpec::Matchers.last_matcher = matcher
    return ::RSpec::Matchers::BuiltIn::PositiveOperatorMatcher.new(actual) if matcher.nil?

    **match = matcher.matches?(actual, &block)**
    return match if match

    message = message.call if message.respond_to?(:call)

    message ||= matcher.respond_to?(:failure_message_for_should) ?
                matcher.failure_message_for_should :
                matcher.failure_message

    if matcher.respond_to?(:diffable?) && matcher.diffable?
      ::RSpec::Expectations.fail_with message, matcher.expected, matcher.actual
    else
      ::RSpec::Expectations.fail_with message
    end
  end
end
```

The simplest version? It compares the "actual" with the provided block, checking for equality. Here's the `freeman` version:

```ruby
module Kernel
  def test(description, &block)
    KFTest.new(description, block).run
  end
end

KFTest = Struct.new(:description, :block) do
  def run
    status = block.call ? true : false
    puts '#{ description }: #{ status }'
    if status.is false
      line = block.source_location.join(': ')
      puts '  from #{ line }'
    end
    return status
  end
end
```

Some of the things are extra: the `puts` statement is just to have some sense of output - I considered taking it out and just returning true or false but that's not super helpful when you're writing a separate test file.

I love `Rspec`. I wrote `freeman` because I want to understand how `Rspec` works in a more well-rounded route. In the meantime, I've begun integrating `freeman` in some personal scripts that don't require full testing frameworks, and I'm impressed with how fast it is.

A simple test with `freeman.rb` required outside of the gem:

```ruby
# test.rb
require './freeman'

test 'A string is indeed a string' do
  'This is a string'.class.is String
end

# time ruby test.rb
A string is indeed a string: true
ruby test.rb  0.05s user 0.04s system 96% cpu 0.092 total
```

With the gem:

```ruby
# test.rb
require 'freeman'

test 'A string is indeed a string' do
  'This is a string'.class.is String
end

# time ruby test.rb
A string is indeed a string: true
ruby test.rb  0.23s user 0.05s system 98% cpu 0.284 total
```

It's surprising the amount of time using Bundler can add to the script. Either way, it's quite quick!
