I'm really curious about the target market for products like [ShipFast](https://shipfa.st).

The core marketing for any of these frameworks is "I'll help you build quickly". 

The thing that gets missed with all of them is that you have to be a pretty skilled programmer as soon as you go off the beaten path.

I'm working on a JavaScript-based MVP right now around real estate + AI, so I bought ShipFast because I wanted to have all of the auth/payments stuff done for me. But I pretty quickly found myself going into the internals and drastically altering some of the core decisions in the codebase -- what mailers to use, how auth works, etc.

Because I only paid \$200ish for it, that's not a big deal. But some of these frameworks are more than \$1000! That would hurt a bit more.

It's an interesting idea, and there's a ton of space for this stuff on the web. But if you aren't an expert-level JS dev, it may be more frustrating than just starting from scratch.
