If youâ€™re using Windows for your development work like I am, youâ€™ll want to quickly customize your Windows Terminal application to have a better color scheme combination.

Hereâ€™s a quick video on how to do it ðŸ“º

<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="113" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etRe7gXlaEY?feature=oembed" width="200"></iframe></figure>Hereâ€™s the text guide, too!

First, download [ColorTool](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal/tree/main/src/tools/ColorTool) on GitHub and extract the source from the ZIP file.

In your terminal, navigate to the downloaded ColorTool source, and apply a theme from the provided `schemes` folder:

```
./ColorTool.exe -x schemes/solarized_dark.itermcolors
```

A neat feature of ColorTool is that it supports iTerm2 themes. iTerm2-Color-Schemes is a popular GitHub repo with 230+ color schemes for the iTerm2 terminal, but ColorTool allows you to apply them to your Windows Terminal too! Check out [iterm2colorschemes.com](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/), find the theme you want, and save the file locally.

Once the file has been saved locally, move it into the `ColorTool/schemes` directory, and apply it in the same way as you applied the Solarized theme. In the video, I use [Dracula+](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/master/schemes/Dracula%2B.itermcolors):

`./ColorTool.exe -x schemes/Dracula+.itermcolors`
