tl;dr - the `rails-cloudflare-turnstile` gem[^1] ([GitHub link](https://github.com/instrumentl/rails-cloudflare-turnstile)) is a great way to add [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile) to your Rails app. Let's learn how to use it!

## Setup

First, install the gem:

```sh
$ bundle add rails-cloudflare-turnstile
```

If you haven't enabled Turnstile yet in your Cloudflare account, follow the ["Get Started" guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/). You'll need a sitekey and secret key. Make sure to associate it with your domain too - for instance, `kristianfreeman.com` - in the Turnstile settings.

Add your sitekey and secret key to your Rails app - I like to use `rails credentials:edit`:

```sh
$ rails credentials:edit -e development
$ rails credentials:edit -e production
```

My credentials are structured like this:

```yaml
cloudflare_turnstile:
  site_key: foo
  secret_key: bar
```

Create an initializer file, called `config/initializers/turnstile.rb`:

```ruby
RailsCloudflareTurnstile.configure do |c|
  c.site_key = Rails.application.credentials.cloudflare_turnstile[:site_key]
  c.secret_key = Rails.application.credentials.cloudflare_turnstile[:secret_key]
  c.fail_open = false
end
```

## Usage

First, we'll add the Turnstile JS script into an application layout file. If you are super performance-sensitive, you may want to do this _specifically_ on the pages you're going to use Turnstile. Here, I'll just add it in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:

```erb
<head>
  <%= cloudflare_turnstile_script_tag %>
</head>
```

In your forms, you can use the `<%= cloudflare_turnstile %>` partial to embed the Turnstile UI element right into your form. For instance, on a signup page:

```erb
<div>
  <%= cloudflare_turnstile %>
  <%= f.submit t("passwordless.sessions.new.submit"), class: "btn" %>
</div>
```

**Importantly, you also need to validate on the server-side!** Speaking as a CF employee who has talked to the Turnstile team, there is a lot of people implementing Turnstile... without the server-side validation.

Users are created in my app in `UsersController#create`. Let's validate the Turnstile data before calling that method:

```ruby {2-3,9-13}
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :validate_cloudflare_turnstile, only: [:create] if Rails.env.production?
  rescue_from RailsCloudflareTurnstile::Forbidden, with: :forbidden_turnstile

  def create
    # Implementation of creating users
  end

  private
  def forbidden_turnstile
    flash[:error] = "We had a problem creating your account."
    redirect_to root_path
  end
```

If the validation fails, the gem will throw an `RailsCloudflareTurnstile::Forbidden` exception. You need to `rescue_from` that exception in the controller, and do something with that failure. I prefer not to tell users - they're probably spammers - that their validation against Turnstile's rules fail.

Turnstile is great - really easy to configure, and literally saving me money by reducing the strain on my servers and ancillary analytics/marketing products, by reducing the number of junk users being added to my app. It only took ~15 minutes to get this implemented on one of my Rails apps, and I'm already seeing results.

[^1]: Not my gem! But it's great - thanks to Instrumentl for building it.
