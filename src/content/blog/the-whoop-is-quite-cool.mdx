I owned an Oura ring for a few years. It was bulky, and it had pretty limited features in the app.

Then, about a month and a half ago, it just stopped working. I couldn't charge it past 1%. And it was out of warranty. Yikes.

So I switched to the WHOOP. I'm actually quite happy with it! 

Here are a few things I like about it:

1. "Behaviors"

One of WHOOP's core loops is the Journal. Every day, it will ask "Did any of these things happen yesterday?" That list is a customizable list of behaviors, both positive and negative, like:

- Wore blue-light glasses
- Drank alcohol
- Shared a bed

Tracking these is actually pretty interesting! You can set goals for these as well. For instance, "I want to wear blue-light glasses four nights this week".

2. Behaviors => scores

Once you've set these behaviors, WHOOP will start to interpret the correlation between them and your actual sleep/recovery scores. I'm not sure how accurate it is. 

It's been cool to see a relationship between some of these behaviors, and my sleep score. Not surprisingly, for instance, if I go to bed at a consistent time, my sleep score is higher (about 2 or 3 points). 

As a very light drinker, it was nice to see that when I drink alcohol, it hasn't had a substantial impact on my recovery the next day.

Oura didn't do anything like this! I'm impressed with it so far. Even if it is a very small amount of processing power for them to determine this stuff, it _feels_ like it is doing more than my Oura did, which makes the subscription feel worth it. Speaking of...

3. I don't know about the subscription yet

WHOOP is \$30/mo. That subscription includes the device, any upgrades/replacements, and access to the software. 

The Oura is \$299-\$349 for the device, with a $6/mo subscription.

I haven't had it long enough to know yet whether the device coverage is truly that straightforward. But if it is, it's very interesting. 

I don't generally like _renting_ stuff, which is what this model pretty much is. I won't ever _own_ a WHOOP, I'll just be renting it. But considering that the sensors aren't open/accessible anyway (at least, as far as I know), that's probably a compromise you have to make.

Overall, I'm happy with it so far. The Oura was bulky. And the app was interesting at first (the novelty of it, at least) but I quickly found it a pain to navigate. 

I'm finding the WHOOP app compelling enough that I want to open it around and poke around at things. I want to find new behaviors to track. I want to make sure the data is complete. That may change in the future, but it's where I'm at right now.
