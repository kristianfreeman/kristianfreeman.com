“How do you learn to code?”

When I started coding about a decade ago, that was a difficult question to answer.

Projects like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) were just around the corner, but because there weren’t as many interactive resources as there are now, I relied on long tutorials and books to pick up the basics of HTML, CSS, and [Ruby](/tag/ruby/) on Rails.

Ten years later, the “Learn to code online” ecosystem is **drastically** different. There are a ton of interactive programming tools out there, and everyone (including me) is publishing blog posts, videos, and courses.

In a way, it may actually be _more_ overwhelming to start now than it was a decade ago.

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) stands out in that huge ecosystem. It’s a non-profit organization that publishes thousands of hours of free courses, blog posts, and videos.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking recently about the basics—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and how I could teach it on my YouTube channel.

Instead of reinventing the wheel, I realized that a valuable resource I could provide would be an up-to-date “codethrough” of freeCodeCamp’s incredible curriculum: walking through _every_ exercise, lesson, and challenge, and adding my own spin on it where possible.

**Today, I’m starting that challenge by releasing my code walkthrough of freeCodeCamp’s Basic HTML and HTML5 curriculum, where you’ll learn about HTML tags, attributes, and inputs. Watch the video below, or [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2xupbFDaNI):**
