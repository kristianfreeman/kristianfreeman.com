[Cloudflare Stream](https://cloudflare.com/products/stream/) is a service that allows you to host videos for your website. It can be purchased as part of a $10/month plan that includes [Cloudflare Images](https://cloudflare.com/products/images/), with up to 1k minutes of video hosting and 5k minutes of video _delivery_ included.

In my [Workers GraphQL Server](/workers-graphql-server) post, I included a video walkthrough of how to use the project. It's hosted with Stream.

## Integration

Here's how I integrated it into my site:

1. Upload the video to Stream
2. Get the video ID
3. Install the [Cloudflare Stream React component](https://github.com/cloudflare/stream-react): 

```bash
$ npm install @cloudflare/stream-react
```

4. Import the component into the blog post and use it (MDX supports JSX components):

import StreamVideo from "@/components/StreamVideo";

I've been working on updating the [`workers-graphql-server`](https://github.com/kristianfreeman/workers-graphql-server) project.

Five years ago, it was one of the first things I built after joining [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). Since then, the way that we write Workers has changed a lot.

The [new v2 release](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-graphql-server/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha) is a complete rewrite. Some big changes:

1. Supports Wrangler v2 (better local dev, deployment, bindings, etc.)
2. Written as a module Worker (modern syntax for writing Workers)
3. Built on top of [Hono](https://honojs.dev/)
4. Examples for integrating external data sources, and service bindings
5. Updated implementation of the [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) cache

I made a video showing how the new version works. Check it out!

<StreamVideo client:only="react" src="8e7113ab230ea2e352270dba1101b5f3" />
```

Note the usage of the `client:only` attribute. This is a [feature of Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/partial-hydration/) that allows you to only hydrate the component on the client-side. This is important because the Stream component will try to create a new `<video>` tag on the client, so if it tries to render on the server, the video content won't show up.

## Captions

A recent feature that Stream added is the ability to add captions. The cool part is that it can use [Workers AI](https://ai.cloudflare.com) to generate the captions automatically.

<Image src={streamCaptions} alt="Stream Captions UI" width={400} />

Selecting this option will generate captions for the video in just a few minutes. Once the captions are generated, you can use them by providing a `defaultTextTrack` prop to the `<Stream>` component that matches the language of the captions:

```tsx ins={6}
import { Stream } from "@cloudflare/stream-react";

<Stream 
  client:only="react" 
  controls 
  defaultTextTrack="en"
  src="$videoId" 
/>
```

If you're like me, you may be a little disappointed with the caption quality. Since Stream uses AI, it's not perfect. Instead, generating your own caption _locally_, so you have the ability to easily tweak it, might be a good option.

To do this, I used [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) to use a higher-quality Whisper AI model to generate a first pass of the captions. Then I opened the `.vtt` file in Vim and fixed some of the references to technical terms. The captions still aren't perfect, but they're decent and legible. After creating those captions, I re-uploaded them and replaced the generated captions inside of Stream.

## My component

I created a component that I can use in my blog posts to make it easier to include a video. It allows me to style and space the video component to fit the design of my site. Here's the code for `components/StreamVideo.tsx`:

```tsx title="components/StreamVideo.tsx"
import { Stream } from "@cloudflare/stream-react";

export default function StreamVideo({ src }: { src: string }) {
  return (
    <div className="mt-4">
      <Stream
        controls
        defaultTextTrack="en"
        src={src}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
