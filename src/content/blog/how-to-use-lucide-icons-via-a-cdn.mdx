Similar to my standardization [on shadcn](https://kristianfreeman.com/brief-shadcnui-review/), I'm starting to lean on [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) as my icon library of choice. Usage in React is really simple - you install the package, import whatever icon you want, and get an SVG that can be customized via sane props for size, color, etc (and you can pass CSS, too).

If you want to use it in other places, you'll need to use `lucide-static` ([documentation](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-static)). I recently shipped icons in my nav on this website, and I was impressed with how easy it was to use. It's just an img tag, with [unpkg.io](https://unpkg.io) as the CDN. Here's how I use it in my nav:

```html
<img src="https://unpkg.com/lucide-static@latest/icons/house.svg" /> Home
```
