[Astro](https://astro.build) is excellent for building blogs and documentation sites. 

Over the weekend, I implemented [Gangsheet.app’s blog](https://gangsheet.app/blog) using the built-in [content collection system](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)[^1], and I was impressed at how easy it was. In this blog post, I’ll lay out how I implemented, with real code samples.

## Astro’s Content Collection system

Astro has a built-in way to import `.md`, `.mdx`, `.yaml`, and `.json` files, and use them to generate pages for your site. These files are parsed and strictly typed using [Zod](https://zod.dev).

I’m not tuned in to Astro’s development cycle, but I can speak as a developer who’s been in the static site/Jamstack space for a long time - Astro’s content layer is _excellent_. In a past life, I completely abused Gatsby’s content generation system to great effect. For instance, generating programatic SEO pages for a frontend development job board by generating massive amounts of combinatorial category pages[^4].

With that history, I’m pretty well-versed in what the space looks like for using local and remote data to generate static-first sites. The example I lay out in this post - generating a blog - is very straightforward. The number of pages generated is N+1, where N is the number of blog posts (plus one index page). But some of the things that Astro does - no doubt due to better tooling, and experience seeing where some Jamstack sites have fallen short - have me very optimistic that this is a good platform to build on.

## Define a content collection

For [Gangsheet](https://gangsheet.app), I wanted a blog. The posts are authored in Markdown, stored in `src/content/blog/*.md`. These posts should be parsed, and then rendered at both `/blog` (the index of _all_ posts), and `/blog/:slug` (the page for each individual post).

First, we’ll create the folder `src/content/blog`, and then fill in `src/content/config.ts`, which configures all content collections for our app:

```typescript
import { defineCollection, reference, z } from 'astro:content';

const blogCollection = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    excerpt: z.string(),
    author: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      x: z.string(),
    }),
    publishedAt: z.date(),
    related: z.array(reference('blog')),
  }),
});

export const collections = {
  'blog': blogCollection,
};
```

A blog post has:

- A title
- An excerpt
- An author, with a name and 𝕏 @username
- A publishedAt date
- Related posts

A few interesting things to note here:

1. No slug! The slug is generated automatically for each post, based on the filename (e.g. `src/content/blog/hello-world.mdx` is, of course, `/blog/hello-world`).[^2]
2. Related posts - woah! You can reference other types, or the _same_ type. We’ll see how easy this is when authoring, in just a second.[^3]

## Add a blog post

We can generate a blog post by creating a new Markdown file in `src/content/blog`. I’ll create `src/content/hello-world.md`, below:

```markdown
---
title: Hello world!
publishedAt: 2024-10-04
excerpt: My first blog post on my new Astro blog.
author: 
  name: Kristian Freeman
  x: kristianf_
related:
  - the-history-of-hello-world
---

Hello world! This is my new blog post.
```

Lots of interesting things to dig into here - luckily, it’s all pretty straightforward. `title`, `publishedAt`, and `excerpt` are simple string/date fields. `author` is an object (maybe a dictionary technically?) with nested fields. 

`related` is a collection of other blog posts, based on the `slug` parameter (again, defined by the filename). We’ll look at how to access the related blog posts in the blog post page, later on.

Anything after the frontmatter is, of course, the content itself. Astro supports MDX, so you should be able to do fancy React component stuff here, too. I haven’t found a need for that yet, but if you want to see an example of how it works, check out Astro’s [“Add reading time” recipe](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/reading-time/).

## Implement page generation

Now, we have a content collection, living at `src/content/blog` - how do we use it?

First, let’s briefly review Astro’s “page” functionality:

1. Pages live inside `src/pages`
2. Pages use the `.astro` extension, which executes JavaScript and allows React or other front-end composition
3. They use file-based routing: `src/pages`

We’ll create two pages:

1. `src/pages/blog.astro` - the blog index.
2. `src/pages/blog/[slug].astro` - the template for each individual blog post.

### Blog index

Defining the blog index page involves two steps - first, getting the collection using `getCollection` from the `astro:content` import. Then, we can render the blog posts using HTML:

```astro
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";

const posts = await getCollection("blog");
const sortedPosts = posts.sort(
  (a, b) => b.data.publishedAt.getTime() - a.data.publishedAt.getTime(),
);
---

<div>
  {sortedPosts.map((post) => (
    <div>
      <h2>
        <a href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>
          {post.data.title}
        </a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Published at {post.data.publishedAt}
      </p>
      <p>{post.data.excerpt}</p>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```

It won’t be indicated in the above code sample, but each `post` here is strongly typed. That means that `post.slug` and `post.data`, as well as everything _inside_ `data`, have the benefit of TypeScript magic in your editor. If `excerpt`, for instance, was optional, we would be encouraged, via our editor and Astro’s build workflow, to handle the null case better.

### Post page

```astro
import { getEntry, getEntries } from "astro:content";

const { slug } = Astro.params;
if (!slug) return Astro.redirect("/blog");

const post = await getEntry("blog", slug);
if (!post) return Astro.redirect("/blog");

const { Content, headings } = await post.render();
const relatedPosts = await getEntries(post.data.related);
---

<div>
  <article>
    <h1>{post.data.title}</h1>

    <div>
      <time datetime={post.data.publishedAt.toString()}></time>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>{post.data.author.name}</p>
    </div>

    <div id="content"><Content /></div>
  </article>

  <section>
    <h2>Related Posts</h2>

    {relatedPosts.map((relatedPost) => (
      <div>
        <h3><a href={`/blog/${relatedPost.slug}`}>{relatedPost.data.title}</a></h3>
      </div>
    ))}
  </section>
</div>
```

First, we grab the `slug` param from `Astro.params`. Then we use it to grab the specific post for this page - `getEntry(‘blog’, slug)`. `post.render()` pushes the Markdown through Astro’s MDX compiler, and returns a `Content` component that can be rendered on the page, as well as an array representing all the `headers` (`h2`, `h3`, etc.) for the content[^5].

The rendering is similar to what we did on the index page. `post.data` contains everything inside of the frontmatter for the post, so you can pull `title`, `excerpt`, `author`, etc. out and reference it wherever you need it in the HTML.

When we need to load related posts, we can call `getEntries` (note _plural_, not singular) to load all of the posts specified in `post.data.related`. We get an array back of related posts - still strictly parsed + typed; basically identical to the `posts` array we had on the index page. This is _super powerful_. I love this implementation!

## Conclusion

I’m really happy I invested time in learning Astro’s content collection system. I haven’t yet had the chance to use Astro’s [new system (in beta)](https://5-0-0-beta.docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/), but when Astro v5 is properly released, I’ll do a follow up blog post on what’s changed.

I [wrote last week](https://kristianfreeman.com/deploying-astro-applications-to-cloudflare/) about investing in learning Astro. This continues to pay off. I’ve been able to build a lot of [complex functionality](https://x.com/kristianf_/status/1842344138131288118) in it, and most of the issues I’ve run into have been totally solvable - even the hard stuff, like auth, dynamic data loading, etc.

What I’m excited about most with the content collection system is that it feels like it lives inside of [my app](https://gangsheet.app), which is quite complex, without resorting to hacks. It fits into the rest of the app in a way that makes sense. For instance, if I wanted to pin the most recent blog post as an “announcement” banner on my dashboard page - I wouldn’t have to make a crazy GraphQL query and combine dynamic and static pages in a way that feels bad. I can just call `getCollection(“blog”)` on any Astro page and render it out. No hacks needed!

[^1]: I didn’t use Astro’s new v5 beta, which has apparently rewritten this system. I’m interested to see how it changed - maybe that will be a future post.
[^2]: You can also manually override the slug in the front-matter of the blog post.
[^3]: As I’m writing this blog post, I’m realizing that _author_ could be an awesome win here in terms of referencing. Instead of putting the author name/𝕏 username on _every post_, I could set up "src/content/authors/kristian.md" and just pass that reference in every blog post.
[^4]: Given X number of location categories, Y number of framework/language categories, and Z number of “experience”/skill-level categories, generate `X*Y*Z` number of SEO-optimized pages, like “senior React.js jobs in the United States”. I was generating thousands of pages and running up against the container my site was building in - with Netlify at the time - running out of memory. Fun times!
[^5]: You can use this to generate a table of contents. See an example on [a blog post](https://gangsheet.app/blog/announcing-gangsheet) from Gangsheet’s blog.
