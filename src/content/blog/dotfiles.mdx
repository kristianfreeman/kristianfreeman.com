The usage of dotfiles is quite common with programmers. For a long time, I used
other people's dotfiles - [Zach Holman][holman] from Github, [Ryan Bates][bates]
from Railscasts, and a couple others.

These worked pretty well, and my only complaint with them was my relative lack
of understanding how they worked. Everyone's setup is different, and although
other people's dotfiles (which are quite popular - both Zach and Ryan's average
1500+ stars and 500+ forks on Github) can help me get to a better workflow,
I began to feel like setting up my own workflow might be a better solution.

Partially this was because when I originally forked their dotfiles, I didn't
feel experienced enough to have an opinion on things. My choice of a shell, for
instance, would be dictated by whichever the dotfiles I was using preferred.

So I rolled [my own dotfiles][myown]. I thought I would take some time to
document my dotfiles, though anything deeper than a high-level overview could
become woefully out of date, so I'll keep it brief:

My software choices are pretty simple and standard for a Mac user.
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) for compiling and installing most software. After
that, [ZSH], [Vim], and [tmux].

I wrote about tmux in a [post][tmuxpost] at the beginning of the year, though that
setup relied a bit on extraneous features using [tmux-powerline][powerline] - did I
really need to see the weather in my tmux bar if I could just look out the damn
window? I decided to roll my own [tmux.conf] and have it be refreshingly minimal.

Of note in the tmux.conf is a single 'powerline'-esque feature: the output of a now
playing script and the date/time. Date and time is obvious, and my now playing script
is important as I often listen to internet radio and would like to know what song is
playing. I wrote about the implementation of this script in "[Now Playing Script]".

I use ZSH, as I'm quite fond of the tab completion and I think [oh-my-zsh] is
a pretty great tool for tricking your command-line prompt. I use the
'kennethreitz' theme.

My vim setup requires a bit more writing, though I plan to expand that into
a later post. For now, my [vimrc] explains my usage patterns and by using
[Vundle] and `:BundleInstall`, you can get a setup fairly similar to mine.

Other miscellaneous things worth mentioning:

I alias `less` as `vim -u ~/.vimrc.more`, which is a read-only vim
configuration with keys similar to `less`. It supports syntax highlighting,
which was the primary reason for my switch.

I'm a huge fan of aliases - anything over three characters should be aliased,
in my opinion. You can see my continually growing list of aliases in [this
file](https://github.com/imkmf/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/aliases).

I've begun writing more shell functions, which has been a lot of fun to learn.
The file is [here](https://github.com/imkmf/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/functions).
Here's a couple I've been writing recently:

- `c`: `cd` and `ls` so I can keep track of where I am.
- `f`: I always forget how to use `ack`, so this function simply searches with
  ack using specified arguments. This should really be replaced by me just
  knowing ack syntax.
- `t`: A function for running Rails tests - if `script/test` exists, run
  the standard Rails tests, otherwise, run `rspec`.
- `mux`: This one is pretty interesting and I use it all the time: it searches
  for an existing tmux session and asks if you'd like to join it; if not, it
  starts a new one for you. This isn't really that big of a deal, but it's
  handy to keep tabs on all the tmux sessions I have open, as I often
  unintentionally duplicate.
- `post` and `fpost`: these two are for my work on this site! `post` creates
  a new time-formatted markdown post with my argument as the name (I'm lazy),
  and `fpost` searches through existing posts, opening the correct one based on
  the keyword provided. After fifteen posts or so, navigating a directory of
  markdown files titled "2012-01-01..., 2012-01-02... etc." gets pretty
  tedious.

As for the dotfiles itself, I use a custom ruby script called `[go-time]` to
symlink my dotfiles over, skipping them if they already exist. It's a small
thing, but not writing the dotfiles as hidden files makes things a lot easier.
It's pretty simple to work with invisible files in vim, but for Sublime Text
and other GUI text editors, it can get a little tedious.
