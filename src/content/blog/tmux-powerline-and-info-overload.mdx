I've written about
tmux before, and
I still find it unabashedly awesome. As I've been gluing pieces of status-bar
code together, I've been on the lookout for something a bit more organized --
thus discovering [tmux-powerline](https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline) was
a bit of a relief.

You'll proabably to have to expand that to see the details, but there's
a couple little improvements that have a big effect on staying in the terminal.

- The local IP address is handy for using on multiple computers
  ([dotfiles!](http://github.com/imkmf/dotfiles)) for quick ssh'ing.
- The git status (branch, # of changes) is awesome and responsive - after
  committing, it'll disappear within a second.
- The "now_playing" script is my favorite: it supports iTunes, Rdio, Spotify,
  even Last.fm! I'm using Rdio right now, but knowing I can tweak the config
  fairly easily and have it *just work* is preferable to my old Applescript
  monstrosity.
- Weather: because we don't go outside when we program.
- Date and time for fullscreen terminals. Awesome.

This addon has been a total game-changer for me in the last couple days in
terms of motivation - I *want* to stay in the terminal now. It may seem like
info overload but I find it to be the perfect amount to be able to quickly
glance without switching contexts back to the GUI. Next up? Figuring
out that whole Vim thing...
