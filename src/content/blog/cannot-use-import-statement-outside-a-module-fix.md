The common JavaScript error "Cannot use import statement outside a module" indicates issues in importing modules and occurs in non-ECMAScript Module (ESM). Here’s a quick solution for both Browser and Node.js (sometimes referred to as "server-side JavaScript") environments.

## Browser

Ensure your JavaScript code runs in ESM by using the `module` type script tag:

```html
<!-- Before -->
<script src="your-file.js"></script>

<!-- After -->
<script type="module" src="your-file.js"></script>
```

If you have concerns about whether your users’ browsers support the `type="module"` directive, check out the ["JavaScript modules via script tag" page on Can I use](https://caniuse.com/es6-module).

## Node.js / server-side

There are two key ways to resolve this error.

### Updating the file extension

Try changing the ‘.js’ extension to ‘.mjs’: Node.js treats ‘.mjs’ as ES modules.

```bash
$ mv server.js server.mjs
```

If that doesn’t work, you can modify the project’s `package.json`. Include `"type": "module"` to your [package.json](/package-json-for-javascript-adventurers/) to interpret ‘.js’ files as ES modules.

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

If you don’t have a `package.json` for your project, run `npm init -y` to create one first.
