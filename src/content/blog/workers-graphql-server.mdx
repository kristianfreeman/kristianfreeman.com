I've been working on updating the [`workers-graphql-server`](https://github.com/kristianfreeman/workers-graphql-server) project.

Five years ago, it was one of the first things I built after joining [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). Since then, the way that we write Workers has changed a lot.

The [new v2 release](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-graphql-server/releases/tag/2.0.0) is a complete rewrite. Some big changes:

1. Supports Wrangler v2 (better local dev, deployment, bindings, etc.)
2. Written as a module Worker (modern syntax for writing Workers)
3. Built on top of [Hono](https://honojs.dev/)
4. Examples for integrating external data sources, and service bindings
5. Updated implementation of the [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) cache

I made a video showing how the new version works. Check it out!
