[Aspirin is known to have a great number of protective effects.](http://raypeat.com/articles/aging/aspirin-brain-cancer.shtml) Many people in the bioenergetics space are taking it on a regular basis - sometimes daily. I'm not quite there yet, but I at least wanted to source high quality aspirin so I had it in my pantry. Most aspirins come in coated pills, with other junk that I don't want. I wanted pure aspirin - literally, the powder.

It turns out that one of the best sources for pure aspirin comes from an unlikely place: farm stores. Tractor Supply, in the US, is one of the biggest. Lots of farmers give their livestock pure aspirin powder. In the US, there's a brand called Aniprin that sells aspirin powder.

When we were traveling this summer in Washington State, and I first discovered this would be the best spot to pick up pure aspirin, I stopped by my local Tractor Supply. And I was in luck! They had Aniprin. But a quick search on 𝕏 indicated this isn't quite what I wanted. It was _Aniprin F_ - a flavored form of Aniprin with molasses and a few other things in it.

It turns out that livestock - just like humans - love something a little bit sweeter. _Aniprin F_ is the _flavored_ version, and _Aniprin P_, the "pure" version that is just acetylsalicylic acid, is a lot harder to get. There was lots of Aniprin F at the Tractor Supply, but no Aniprin P.

A month later, when I returned to Texas, I stopped at another Tractor Supply close to home. Again, no Aniprin P, just Aniprin F.

So I ordered it [on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4eNqKOc) instead. It took a while to get here, but now I have pure aspirin. It's _way_ more than I need any time soon - 1/4 tsp is roughly 1g, which is a fine dose for now - and I'm not using it every day yet. It's probably hundreds of doses for about $30, which is a good deal! It was a bit of a quest to get to pure aspirin. It shouldn't have been so hard to get pure powder, without a bunch of junk in it.
