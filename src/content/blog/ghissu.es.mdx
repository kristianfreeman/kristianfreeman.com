Update: Since most browsers won't load a non-HTTPS link on a HTTPS-enabled site (including this one), I'm going to continue to use the Heroku link for this project until I resolve the HTTPS issues.

A quick announcement about something I built: [ghissu.es](https://www.issues-embed.herokuapp.com).

It's a simple way to embed GitHub issues on a webpage, using an easy to remember script tag:

    <script src="https://www.issues-embed.herokuapp.com/rails/rails?issue=13059"></script>

I just built it today, so there's some features missing, most notably the comments for the issue. As always, the project is [open source](https://github.com/imkmf/ghissu.es), so feel free to take a peek inside - it's powered by [rails-api](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api).

Here's a test embed below:
