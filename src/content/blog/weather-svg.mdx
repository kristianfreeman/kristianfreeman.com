While building [San Marcos TX Life](/smtx-life), I wanted to add a little weather section to my newsletter. I wanted something that was easy to use, and that would be lightweight and fast. I built something and made it open-source - link above.

<Image src={WeatherSVG} alt="Weather SVG" />

_Example of what is generated. These SVGs are animated in the actual email, depending on the client!_

## What it does

The service is pretty straightforward - you give it a ZIP code and it gives you back a nice SVG showing the next 7 days of weather. Each day shows:

- Temperature highs and lows
- A little animated weather icon (the sun actually spins!)
- Basic description like "Cloudy" or "Rain"

## How it works

I'm using Cloudflare Workers for this. There's a scheduled task that pre-generates forecasts for ZIP codes I care about, and an HTTP endpoint that serves them up.

The interesting bit is how it figures out the weather icons. OpenWeather gives you stuff like cloud cover percentage and precipitation, so I wrote some logic to map that to weather conditions. Like if there's over 80% cloud cover, that's "Overcast" with a cloudy icon. Under 20% and you get a spinning sun.

## Tech bits

- TypeScript + Cloudflare Workers
- OpenWeather API for the data
- [KV storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv) to cache the forecasts
- SVG for the visuals (keeps it lightweight)
- URL params let you tweak the size

The SVGs work great in email (tested in the major clients) and they're super lightweight. Plus since it's all serverless, it costs basically nothing to run.
