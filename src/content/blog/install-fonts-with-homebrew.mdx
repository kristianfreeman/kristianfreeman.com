One of the best parts about [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask). Cask allows you to install GUI apps for macOS using the standard `brew` commands. It used to be a separate installation, but now it is included in Homebrew itself.

Most people are familiar with Cask for installing GUI apps, but you may not know that it also allows you to install fonts. Installing fonts is usually an annoying process:

1. Download the font family
2. Unzip the archive
3. Open every font and click "Install" in Font Book

With Homebrew Cask, you can do this in a single command:

```bash
$ brew install font-$fontname
```

Let's install [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible), the font I use on this site.

You can also search for any font by using `brew search`. This will show the exact cask name that you need to install the font:

```bash
$ brew search atkinson
==> Casks
font-atkinson-hyperlegible
```

I can run `brew install` to automatically install the font, including all variants:

```bash
$ brew install font-atkinson-hyperlegible
```
