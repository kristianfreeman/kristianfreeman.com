I'll be experimenting over the next few months with trying to increase the number of backlinks and general domain rating for this site. I don't know why I haven't thought about this before, but increasing the DR for my literal `firstnamelastname.com` domain seems like a great investment of time throughout the rest of my career. 

I'll document progress below.

**Oct 6, 2024**

DR 14 (!), backlinks 73. My DR is up 5 points, and there's 20 new backlinks.

I'm still building backlinks. I recently found a list of great free backlink sites (think sites you know that have free signups, where linking to your site would be valuable). I now have my virtual assistants going through and creating accounts on all of these sites, linking back to this one. We'll see if that pays off.

One interesting backlink profile is from Bearblog itself - the platform that hosts this blog. When I write on a regular basis, backlinks show up from bearblog.dev, on their recent page. This changes so frequently (lots of people publish on a regular basis) that I think it may be slightly thrashing my baby backlinks profile with a high quality link, then taking it away.

Probably my best backlink from this period: my author bio on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io). I went back and updated my account information on their author profile service, and the backlink points here instead of an URL I own, based on [a previous Twitter username](https://x.com/signalnerve).

DR 9, backlinks 53. Starting point. There's a ton of backlinks from past domains I've had (including my old Twitter handle) that I'm going to try and get to point here. Nowhere to go but up!
