My current recipe for tea at nighttime. It tastes good, and knocks me out about 30-60min after I drink it.

Anecdotally, this has also seemed to increase my time in deep sleep [via my WHOOP](/the-whoop-is-quite-cool), but I haven't tracked it well enough to know for sure. The "you had extra deep sleep last night!" notification seems to be firing pretty regularly since I started making this recipe about a week and a half ago. Great!

## Recipe

- 1 chamomile tea bag ([link](https://amzn.to/3ZO7Suc))
- A2 whole milk
- Raw honey, to taste ([link](https://amzn.to/3ZRK9t7))

## Supplementation

I used to directly put glycine and magnesium glycinate in my tea. There's a lot to love about glycine and magnesium in regards to sleep, but I've adapted slightly for one reason - magnesium glycinate is _literally the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life_. And it doesn't mix super well into tea.

Instead, I supplement the glycine and magnesium glycinate in pill format. This works better for me, it's easier to dose, and I don't have the risk of having to taste any magnesium. 

Here's the specifics:

- 5g glycine ([link](https://lifeblud.co/products/glycine))
- 3.5g magnesium glycinate ([link](https://amzn.to/3PV8oQJ))

## Update

_2025-01-29:_ Just a few updates here. No longer using glycine/magnesium powder directly in tea - supplementing instead. Post updated!

_2024-10-11:_ This is working! My WHOOP score has definitely improved. Still the same recipe I wrote about in the original post.
