My current recipe for tea at nighttime. It tastes good, and knocks me out about 30-60min after I drink it.

Anecdotally, this has also seemed to increase my time in deep sleep [via my WHOOP](/the-whoop-is-quite-cool), but I haven't tracked it well enough to know for sure. The "you had extra deep sleep last night!" notification seems to be firing pretty regularly since I started making this recipe about a week and a half ago. Great!

## Recipe

- 1 chamomile tea bag ([link](https://amzn.to/3ZO7Suc))
- 5g glycine ([link](https://amzn.to/47QvHDw))
- 3.5g magnesium glycinate ([link](https://purebulk.com/products/magnesium-glycinate))
- A2 whole milk
- Raw honey, to taste ([link](https://amzn.to/3ZRK9t7))

## Update

This is working! My WHOOP score has definitely improved. Still the same recipe I wrote about in the original post.
