A running list of health products I'm using â€“ primarily around eliminating toxic PUFAs (_poly-unsaturated fatty acids_), heavy metals, and other nasty modern shit in my daily life.

Updated regularly. If possible, products will be linked to using _affiliate links_ ðŸ§€

- [Aleppo soap](https://amzn.to/47IIzeY) â€“ body soap with two ingredients: laurel oil, and olive oil.
- [Aniprin P](https://amzn.to/3ZzK6BV) â€“ pure aspirin. Per Ray Peat[^1], pure aspirin has a variety of great protective effects. 
- [Sal Suds](https://amzn.to/3XOyiKJ) â€“ Dr. Bronner's cleaning product. I've used the soaps in the past, but just learned about this variant for cleaning. I dilute it heavily and use it for hand washing dishes in my sink. I'm planning to use it in the dishwasher, laundry, and pretty much everywhere else.
- [NOBS Toothpaste Tablets](https://amzn.to/47CSpiv) â€“Â these tablets are awesome. Chew up one tablet and start brushing your teeth. They smell and taste awesome, and they don't have all the crap (no fluoride!) that most toothpaste have.
- [Schwally Zinc & Charcoal Deodorant](https://amzn.to/3U1qdQP) â€“ deodorant. Smells good, and way better list of ingredients to apply on one of the most absorbent parts of your body.

[^1]: _"Although it would undoubtedly be best to grow up eating foods with relatively saturated fats, the use of aspirin preventively and therapeutically seems very reasonable under the present circumstances, in which, for example, clean and well ripened fruits are not generally available in abundance. Preventing blindness, degenerative brain diseases, heart and lung diseases, and cancer with aspirin should get as much support as the crazy public health recommendations are now getting from government and foundations and the medical businesses."_, [Ray Peat, "Aspirin, brain, and cancer"](https://raypeat.com/articles/aging/aspirin-brain-cancer.shtml)
