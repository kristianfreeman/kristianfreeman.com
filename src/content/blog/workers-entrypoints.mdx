Cloudflare Workers traditionally has allowed definition of a single _entrypoint_ for a Workers application. The initial version of Workers did this via an event listener:

```js
const handleRequest = request => {
  return new Response('Hello world!')
}

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})
```

In the last few years, most developers have migrated to the "module" syntax for Workers, as we've standardized on it in our tooling:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    return new Response('Hello world!')
  }
}
```

This means that your Workers code, for instance, defined in `index.js`, has a _default export_. That export is a _module_ with a collection of functions representing different events - `fetch`, to handle HTTP requests, or `scheduled`, to trigger on a [cron trigger](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cron-triggers).

This module is the primary _entrypoint_ for a Workers application. But it turns out that you can define other entrypoints to serve other purposes.

## Workflows

Yesterday, I wrote about [Cloudflare Workflows](/cloudflare-workflows):

To define a workflow, you can export a class that extends `WorkflowEntrypoint`. The module that is exported by default still allows `fetch`, `scheduled`, and other events to access the Worker:

```ts title="src/index.ts" collapse={3-9, 14-16}
// Workflow entrypoint
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, Params> {
  async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
    await step.sleep('wait on something', '1 minute');

    await step.do('test step', async () => {
      return 'OK, done!';
    });
  }
}

// Module entrypoint
export default {
  async fetch(req: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    return new Response('Hello world!');
  }
};
```

This is an interesting model! It allows you to define multiple entry points for a single Workers application. 

## Workers RPC

In an upcoming release of [workers-graphql-server](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-graphql-server), I've added preliminary support for _Workers RPC_. Workers RPC allows you to access Workers application _from one another_. Let's look at how that works.

You can arbitrarily export any number of classes from your Workers application, as long as they extend the `WorkersEntrypoint` class. For example, a `MoviesService` that connects to a D1 database[^1]. That's right - more entrypoints!

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

export class MoviesService extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  async getMovies() {
    const query = "select * from movies";
    const { results: movies } = await this.env.DB
      .prepare(query)
      .all();
    return movies;
  };
}

// Rest of HTTP-based handlers
```

In any project, you can then import this class via service bindings:

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
name = "workers-graphql-server"

[[services]]
binding = "MOVIES"
entrypoint = "MoviesService"
service = "d1-movie-example"
```

That binding `MOVIES` connects to the `MoviesService` class inside of `d1-movie-example`. You can use it like any other function, but it is a genuine different application, imported somewhat magically:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
function getBestMovies(env) {
  const movies = await env.MOVIES.getMovies()
  return movies.sort((a, b) => b.rating - a.rating)
}
```

This is super legit. It's microservice architecture without needing to care about deployments, scaling, or any of that other stuff. Really impressive!

## Conclusion

Sure, I work at CF - but I don't have any particular insight into how entrypoints will evolve on the Workers platform. 

As a long-time user, I'm quite happy to see how entrypoints have evolved into a way to access the same application and core logic through different strategies - not just HTTP requests, but workflows, RPC calls, and (I imagine) even more ways in the future.
