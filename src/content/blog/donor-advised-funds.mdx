It's getting close to the end of the year. During the holidays, lots of people are looking to donate to charity.

Until last year, I wasn't sure how to effectively do that. Obviously, you can just give cash, write a check, etc. - but being a personal finance nerd, I figured there was a better way.

_Note: Do your own homework and consult a financial advisor before making any decisions. This post is not intended to be a financial or tax advice._

**Enter Donor Advised Funds (DAFs).** DAFs are a tax-efficient investment vehicle for charitable donations.[^4]

Here's the basic idea: you donate to a DAF, and you're able to immediately deduct the donation from your taxable income. $1000 into the DAF is a $1000 deduction on your taxable income.[^3]

Once that $1000 is in your DAF, you can invest in a variety of ways. You can keep the money in the fund until you're ready to give it to a charity. During that time, the $1000 can grow, just as it would in a 401k or IRA. You can invest it in bonds, ETFs, or even crypto. 

I use [Daffy](https://www.daffy.org/kristian/invite) (referral link)[^1] to manage [my family fund](https://freemanfamilyfund.com). It's easy to use, and they take care of all the donations, account management, and basically every part of the process. I add to my fund on a monthly basis, and the fund is heavily allocated towards crypto[^2]. If you don't want to have a crypto fund, you can invest it in a variety of allocation styles, all centering around cash, bonds, ETFs, with varying degrees of risk.

It was my first year using a DAF in 2023, and I really enjoyed the process. It's awesome to be able to grow a charitable fund through investing. I'll be increasing my donations into my DAF over the next few years, and I'm happy with [Daffy](https://www.daffy.org/kristian/invite) as an all-in-one solution for managing the fund. If you're interested in donating to charities - and getting a tax benefit along the way - I can't recommend it enough.

[^1]: For every signup, we'll both receive $25 in funds to give to charities.
[^2]: Importantly - you're not buying crypto. The fund is invested in crypto, and you're buying a stake in that fund.
[^3]: To a point: you can only contribute up to 60% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) to a DAF.
