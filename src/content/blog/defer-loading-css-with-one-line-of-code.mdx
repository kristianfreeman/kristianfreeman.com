Here's how to defer CSS loading with one line of code, no extra dependencies needed:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/my.css" media="print" onload="this.media='all'">
```

We're setting the `media` property here to "print", meaning that it's only relevant when _printing_ this page. But when `onload` fires, we change the `media` property to all - meaning it's relevant to the page again. The browser will then load the CSS. It's a tricky but effective way of deferring CSS until after page load.
