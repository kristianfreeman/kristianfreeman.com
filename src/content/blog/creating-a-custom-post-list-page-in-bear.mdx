To link to my "Tips" section of my blog – which is any post tagged "tip" – I first tried to link to the standard post list page, with a filter applied:

`https://kristianfreeman.com/blog/?q=tip`

This works, but Bear actually has a feature for embedding blog post lists in any page[^1].

You can create a new page, and insert the list like this:

`{{ posts|tag:"tip" }}`

This allows more customization, since you can add a description, any wrapper text around the list, etc.

Now, my "Tips" page lives at a proper URL: [/tags/tip](/tags/tip).
