I'm really enjoying [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com):

It looks great by default. If you're in React land, it isn't too hard to get up and running â€“ assuming you're already using Tailwind and PostCSS.

I've used it in a few configurations:

- Astro
- Remix
- Next.js
- Vanilla React

I wish there was a version of it that was _just_ CSS. If I could add it into my Rails apps, even with limited functionality (no interactivity, or at least, highly degraded interactivity), that would be awesome. It feels super professional. Maybe I'll start digging into server rendered JS code in Rails apps and see what I can make happen.
