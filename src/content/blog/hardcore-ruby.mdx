I saw this tweet today, and it made me think about some ways in which to destroy Ruby.

If you're not familiar with Ruby, it has a great feature in that any class, method, or object can be altered. For instance, if you want to add a new function for doubling a number:

This comes in handy, a lot. In fact, a lot of what powers Ruby on Rails is this idea of mutability.

Unfortunately, this can also be quite destructive, as seen in the tweet above. I thought it'd be a fun experiment to come up some weird and potentially dangerous pieces of Ruby code.

*More to come here...*
