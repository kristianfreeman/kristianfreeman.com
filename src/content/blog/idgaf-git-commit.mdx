Commit quickly and often. 

It's better to commit a hundred times and be able to checkout _any_ version of your project than to only commit once a day and have very low fidelity into your codebase.

Two aliases for this.

`g` is the "I don't care about git commit logs, just commit" alias. 

`gp` says "just commit whatever _and_ push it".

I run these 20+ times a day for projects where git history is not that important (solo projects).

```zsh
function g() {
  git add .
  git commit -m "$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S)"
}

function gp() {
  g && git push
}
```

BTW - you can always `git reflog` these, either in the UI during a PR merge, or manually in your terminal, if it feels bad 👍
