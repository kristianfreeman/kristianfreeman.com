Like most [Jekyll] sites, this site is written in [Markdown].

There's a lot of differing opinions on the "right" way to write Markdown,
because some portions of it have multiple syntax options. I thought I'd write
down my personal Markdown opinions, as a "style guide" and a log in case this
ideas change.

- Bold and italics: astericks. I use \*'s for emphasis in non-Markdown formats
  (email and IM), so this is a natural one. I don't love underlines, but I'm
  not unopposed to them. To be honest, both asterisks and underlines are hard
  to type because of their shift-key requirement. I'd love for there to be
  a third option, but I can't think of one that looks natural and is easy to
  type (commas maybe?).
- Images: this is one of those instances where HTML is *almost* just as easy,
  but not quite. I prefer the URL syntax: `![alt text](imageurl)`. I have
  a bad habit of not including alt-text, and using that syntax forces me to.
- URLs: I've been using the normal method of Markdown URLs for a couple years
  (`[text](url)`), but I'm beginning to see (especially in large posts) the
  advantage of defining URLs at the bottom of the post. Looking at posts from
  years ago, it's difficult to get back to speed when URLs interrupt the post.
- Headers: I use the single line #/pound syntax, such as `# My Header` and `##
  My Subtitle`. I like this as it visually indents the text for that line
  enough to see that it's a separation of sections, and the new-line `-`/`=`
  syntax offers no kind of indentation.

I'm very used to plain Markdown, but I'd really like to try something like
[MultiMarkdown][mmd] -- it seems to have a lot of cool features, and hopefully
solves some of the above complaints. Maybe it's available for Jekyll? Time to
go researching...
