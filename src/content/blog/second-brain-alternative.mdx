I've been thinking recently about retaining information and the "second brain" ([prev post](https://kristianfreeman.com/second-brain-less/)).

Maybe I don't need a "second brain"! It might be enough to just bookmark things, highlight them, and review the highlights.

It seems like Readwise does this with their [Read](https://readwise.io/read) product. And there's Instapaper and Pocket, too.

Maybe that's enough. I don't write in a way that requires linking previous concepts, where a comprehensive Obsidian vault would be super helpful. Writing code doesn't work like that.

But reviewing concepts and highlights of things I'm reading, especially in a second place away from social media (which is often where I'm finding new articles), may be enough. We'll see!
