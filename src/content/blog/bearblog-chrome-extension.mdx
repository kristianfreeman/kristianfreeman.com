I wrote a quick Chrome extension[^1] that makes it easier to navigate when working with bearblog. 

Features:

- Switcher for navigating between multiple bearblogs
- Quick shortcuts for navigating to some of the most busy pages in the admin (Nav, Posts, Theme, etc.)
- Auto-loading toolbar _on your custom domain_ - think the WordPress navbar that shows up when you're authed on your WordPress site, and looking at the frontend

_The dev toolbar that shows up on both bearblog.dev _and_ your custom domain._

<img alt="Settings" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/kristian/352x.webp" style="max-width: 280px" />

_The settings popup that you can use to set up your sites._

You can find the release [here](https://github.com/kristianfreeman/bearblog-dev-toolbar/releases/tag/v1.0.1). Grab the ZIP and "Load unpacked" in your Chrome extension settings.

[^1]: At least, it _should_ have been quick. I tried to get it working on Safari, which was a terrible experience. The bulk of the code was quick to write.
