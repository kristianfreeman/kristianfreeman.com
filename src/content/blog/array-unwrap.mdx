I often have situations in Rails where I'm calling a method that either returns
a single object or an array of many objects. Take, for example, an ActiveRecord
query that will return a User based on certain specifications:

```
{% gist 6396286 %}
```

In this instance, you'd expect it to return a single User. Because it's an AR
query, however, it returns an instance of `ActiveRecord::Relation`. For our
purposes, this is an array.

In this situation, my solution has often been to just call `user.first`. I'm
not a huge fan of this because it's an array with only one object inside of it
- calling `first` seems to be an inaccurate way of basically saying "get the
  object out of the array".

I discussed this with [Amiel Martin][Amiel], my coworker at [Carnes
Media][carnes], and we determined that this is a pretty standard thing to run
into, and the kind of thing that might be a good Rails pull request.

We came up with this [implementation][commit]:

```
{% gist 6396310 %}
```

The method `unwrap` makes more sense than calling `first` on an array that only
has one object.

We're in the process of preparing this functionality for submission as a Rails
PR - there's so many pull requests at any given time that we've sought out some
thoughts from other Rails programmers on the implementation. If you have any
thoughts on it, feel free to contact [me](http://twitter.com/imkmf) or
