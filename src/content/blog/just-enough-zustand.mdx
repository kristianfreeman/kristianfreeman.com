Here's how to get started with [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), a great state management library for React.

Zustand is really simple, especially compared to some of the state management libraries we used to use in React. It is certainly a very different approach to state management compared to tools like Redux. But I like it a lot! 

It feels scalable - you can roll with a small, single store setup, or you can easily imagine it scaling well to have a ton of different stores, or one _really large_ store that has all your app state. At the end of the day, it still will feel like writing fairly simple, vanilla JavaScript. 

At the core of the library, Zustand provides a function `create`, which allows you to create a store. A store contains all of your piece of state, including the values themselves, as well as functions for modifying those values. 

Per Zustand's docs, here is a very small store:

```jsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
  updateBears: (newBears) => set({ bears: newBears }),
}))
```

That code snippet covers 95% of what you would want to do with Zustand:
  - `bears` is a pure value
  - `increasePopulation` shows how to update a state value _based on previous state_[^2]
  - `removeAllBears` is a straight-forward state clearing
  - `updateBears` takes an argument and uses it to arbitrarily update state

Each makes use of the `set` parameter which is a slightly magical function for updating your store. It _merges_ on your existing state so you can update whatever you need to, without needing to do fancy `Object.assign` merges or anything like that. 

With that store set up, you can import it into components and use it like a hook:

```jsx
function BearCounter() {
  const bears = useStore((state) => state.bears)
  return <h1>{bears} around here...</h1>
}

function Controls() {
  const increasePopulation = useStore((state) => state.increasePopulation)
  return <button onClick={increasePopulation}>one up</button>
}
```

Note that the components import `useStore`, and call it as a function. Here lies one of the few things _you should really know_ about Zustand: when you call this `useStore` function, it will return your state object, like so:

```javascript
const state = useStore()
```

That state object has all your stuff in it! **But you should not do this:**

```javascript
const { bears } = useStore() // Don't do this
```

Again: don't do this! Each time your state updates â€“ that is, _any_ of your state â€“Â this `useStore()` call will cause a re-render. Instead, you should pass a function as the argument to `useStore` that is a _selector_:

```javascript
const bears = useStore(state => state.bears) // Do this
```

Now, your components will only update when their little slices of state â€“Â `state.bears`, `state.whatever` â€“Â updates. This is a big performance boost. In terms of _just enough Zustand_, this is the only slightly tricky thing I can think of that you should know when getting started.

There is certainly more to Zustand, and a lot of that is [in the docs](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction). Dealing with state rehydration, persistence, etc etc etc is all covered there. That's for another post :)

## Something more complex

Back in June 2020, [I made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BchtCWxs7sA) on my YouTube channel about another state management library, Recoil.js. In that video, I made a sample project which used an API to load the "trending" repos on GitHub. That codebase serves as sufficiently complex enough (top-level state, read and written to from multiple child components) that I wanted to port it over to Zustand. 

Here's the final `useStore` object I built. It's more complex than the above example, but still easy enough to follow:

```typescript
type Store = {
  loading: boolean
  repos: {
    daily: any[]
    weekly: any[]
    monthly: any[]
  }
  view: ViewOption
  setView: (view: ViewOption) => void
  loadRepos: () => void
}

export const useStore = create<Store>((set, get) => ({
  loading: false,
  repos: {
    daily: [],
    weekly: [],
    monthly: []
  },
  view: 'daily',
  setView: view => set({ view }),
  loadRepos: async () => {
    const { view, repos } = get()
    set({ loading: true })
    const url = `https://api.gitterapp.com/repositories?since=${view}`;
    const resp = await fetch(url);
    const body = await resp.json();
    set({
      loading: false,
      repos: { ...repos, [view]: body }
    })
  }
}))
```

[Find the source here](https://github.com/kristianfreeman/just-enough-zustand). This stateÂ gets imported selectively throughout all the components in this application, using the selector logic I outlined above. This setup efficiently avoids prop drilling, re-renders, and lots of other junk around performance and ergonomics that React devs commonly have to worry about. The components just grab what state they care about. Easy!

I like Zustand a lot so far. One of my programming side quests this quarter is to go through and refresh all the tools in my React toolbelt.[^1] Zustand feels like a great way to handle state effectively in applications without introducing a ton of extra complexity for complexity's sake.

[^1]: See [my shadcn/ui review](https://kristianfreeman.com/brief-shadcnui-review/).
[^2]: There is a different way to do this, using the `get` function provided by Zustand. I'm not sure which one is better ðŸ¤·
