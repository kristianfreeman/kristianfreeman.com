Cloudflare, as part of the [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) platform, has a file specification for redirects, usually defined via a [`_redirects` file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/redirects/). This feature allows you to specify a list of URLs and their destinations, and Cloudflare will automatically redirect traffic to those URLs to the specified destinations.

It looks like this:

```txt title="_redirects"
/home301 / 301
/home302 / 302
/querystrings /?query=string 301
/twitch https://twitch.tv
/trailing /trailing/ 301
/notrailing/ /nottrailing 301
/page/ /page2/#fragment 301
/blog/* https://blog.my.domain/:splat
/products/:code/:name /products?code=:code&name=:name
```

This is a helpful way to keep broken URLs from piling up on your site, and I wanted to use it inside of my Astro-based site.

Luckily, [the `vite-plugin-cloudflare-redirect`](https://github.com/bluwy/vite-plugin-cloudflare-redirect) was created by a member of Astro's community. I used that Vite plugin and wrapped in an Astro integration package, meaning it's incredibly easy to install:

```sh
$ npx astro add astro-cloudflare-redirects
```

This will do a guided install to add the integration to your Astro project. 

```sh
npx astro add astro-cloudflare-redirects
⚠ astro-cloudflare-redirects is not an official Astro package.
✔ Continue? … yes
✔ Resolving with third party packages...

  Astro will run the following command:
  If you skip this step, you can always run it yourself later

 ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ npm install astro-cloudflare-redirects@^0.0.1  │
 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✔ Continue? … yes
✔ Installing dependencies...

  Astro will make the following changes to your config file:

 ╭ astro.config.mjs ─────╮
 │ // ...                │
 ╰───────────────────────╯

✔ Continue? … yes
  
   success  Added the following integration to your project:
  - astro-cloudflare-redirects
```

You can also install it manually:

```sh
$ npm install astro-cloudflare-redirects
```

Once installed, you can add the integration to your Astro config:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import cloudflareRedirects from 'astro-cloudflare-redirects';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [cloudflareRedirects()],
});
```

## Usage

You can use it by generating a file in `public/_redirects` with the same format as the Cloudflare redirects file. For instance, if you wanted to redirect `/old-url` to `/new-url`, you could create a `_redirects` file like this:

```txt title="_redirects"
/old-url /new-url
```

You can also specify a custom file location, if you'd like:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import cloudflareRedirects from 'astro-cloudflare-redirects';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [cloudflareRedirects({
    redirectsFile: './src/_redirects',
  })],
});
```

## Why build this?

I like Cloudflare's \_redirects file format, but by pulling it into Astro via a Vite plugin, you can use it in any environment. Regardless of how you're deploying your Astro application, you can use this plugin for easy redirect handling.
