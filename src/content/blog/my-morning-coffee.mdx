My morning coffee:

1. Freshly ground [Medium roast Ruta Maya coffee](https://rutamayacoffee.com/)[^1] brewed with Aeropress[^2]
2. 1 scoop collagen peptides[^3]
3. ~5-10g creatine
4. ~300-500mg pure L-theanine[^4] powder
5. 1000 IU vitamin D3 + 200 micrograms vitamin K2[^5]

This is a follow-up to my [sleepy time tea recipe](/sleepy-time-tea)!

I make my morning coffee using an [Aeropress Premium](https://aeropress.com/products/aeropress-coffee-maker-premium). The Aeropress is very easy to use: fussy coffee results without having to do a ten minute ritual. The Premium is all glass, so your coffee isn't passing through any plastic. I'm quite happy with it - which is great because it isn't cheap!

## Why?

Dump of ùïè tweets re: different ingredients in this coffee:

[^1]: I emailed the address on the website to ask about testing, particularly around mycotoxins. The email bounced üíÄ
[^2]: No special process here. There is a whole world of Aeropress brewing, but I just stick with the normal process as laid out in the instructions.
[^3]: Before we were more conscious of ingredients, we had an Amazon subscription for some randomly sourced collagen. At some point, when we run out of our supply of collagen, I'll switch to a more legit/high-quality source.
[^4]: This is new to my recipe, but the interactions between L-theanine and caffeine are well-defined: less jitters, pure caffeine buzz. It's great!
[^5]: I have an Athletics Green-provided supply of this that came with my old AG1 supply. It's a droplet that is completely easy to over-dose - bad design. Another "I'll use it until I run out of it" thing.
