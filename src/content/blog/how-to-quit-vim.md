Press escape, type `:q` (colon q), and press enter.

It’s a long-standing joke that quitting Vim is *incredibly* hard, but the above should work in pretty much every situation. Let’s unpack it.

## Pressing escape to return to normal mode

Vim is a *modal* text editor, meaning that you can enter different *modes* to do different things. By default, Vim is in **normal** mode, which allows you to use the `hjkl` keys to navigate your document. There’s also **insert**, **visual**, **command-line**, **select**, and **ex** — for now, we’ll just focus on getting *out* of those modes into normal mode. You can do this by pressing the ESC (escape) key.

## Type `:q` (colon q) and press enter

You can enter commands into Vim by pressing the colon (`:`) key. You should see a colon (and whatever you type next) in the command bar at the bottom of your Vim window.

Now, you can use the `q` command (short for `quit`) to quit command. Press enter, and you’ll be back out of Vim.
