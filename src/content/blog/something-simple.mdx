I've been searching for the right todo app for a long time. At this point, I think I've used all the "big apps": [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/), [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/), [RTM](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/), [Reminders.app](http://apple.com/ios/), [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), [Wunderlist](http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist), [The Hit List](http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/), [Clear](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/), and so on (seriously, there's so many that I could do this forever). All of them worked great in their various ways -- powerful location-based reminders, contexts, due dates and notification systems, etc.

I'm not a power-user by any means: I usually add a half-dozen tasks on a "busy" day, and I don't need to do powerful filtering like in OmniFocus or Things. Location reminders *are* nice, but I usually remember to check my lists when I go to the store or to work.

I have only one feature that I've looked for in an app, and until now, I haven't found it: tagging. The ability to tag something, and then **easily** go back and look through those tags. OmniFocus does this with contexts, but you have to organize those contexts ahead of time -- same with Things.

I discovered [Cheddar](https://cheddarapp.com) a couple weeks ago and have been incredibly happy with it. It's not updated frequently (in fact, it's [for sale](https://cheddarapp.com/buy) at time of writing) but it follows the workflow I need:

1. Make a tag -- the Twitter-style hashtag notation works fine.

2. *Tap/click* on that tag to see *all of the tasks*. **THAT'S IT.** It shouldn't be too difficult to do that, but Cheddar is the only thing that seems to do it in the way I want.

Cheddar has some other functionality that's nice -- [Markdown] notation, incredibly fast syncing (looking over their [API documentation](https://cheddarapp.com/developer/realtime) shows they use [Pusher](http://pusher.com/) for real-time streaming), and multiple lists. The free version of Cheddar supports *two* lists; a paid subscription ($20 yearly) allows unlimited. Two lists works for me: I have a "Do!" list and a "Buy!" list. The deceptively powerful filtering system inherent in Cheddar's tagging system covers the rest of my bases.

Another thing that appeals to me: both the iOS and Mac app are on [Github](https://github.com/nothingmagical). If I have a complaint or request for a feature, ostensibly I can build it out *myself*. Now that's awesome.
