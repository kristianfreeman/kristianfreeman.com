A "Message of the Day" is a message that shows up any time a user logs in to a Unix machine.

This can be useful if you SSH into a variety of machines throughout the day, and want to leave yourself a note with special information about the machine.

There are actually a ton of different ways to implement this pattern in Unix machines. This blog post will cover some of the ones I know about, as well as the pros and cons of each approach.

## /etc/motd

Unix has a built-in handler for outputting the contents of the `/etc/motd` file. You can confirm this utility is installed by running `man motd`.

Since this is located in /etc, it is only accessible by root. This is a good place to put a message that you want to display to all users:

```bash
sudo echo "Welcome to my machine!" > /etc/motd
```

Support for this file is included in most Unix/Linux distros without any additional config, which is a plus. But this approach is not _by-user_ specific: the same message will be displayed to all users. The next approach will be more useful if you want to display per-user messages.

## Shell profile

While not technically a "Message of the Day", you can also put a message in your shell's profile. This is a file that is executed when you start a new shell.

```bash
$ echo "Welcome to my machine!" > ~/.profile
```

You could even replicate the functionality of `/etc/motd` further by creating `~/.motd` and then adding the following to your `~/.profile`:

```bash title="~/.profile"
if [ -f ~/.motd ]; then
  cat ~/.motd
fi
```

This approach is _by-user_, so it's useful if you are logging into different users on the same machine. If you switch shells or overwrite your profile file, you will lose this, so you need to keep track of it. Although it's manual, it's not super heavy-handed.

## SSH banner

An SSH banner is a file that is displayed when you SSH into a machine. You can configure this globally, or per-user. 

We'll focus on per-user. To set this up, you need to create a file called `~/.ssh/banner` and add the following to it:

```txt title="~/.ssh/banner"
Welcome to my machine!
```

In your global SSH config, you can then match per user and set a banner:

```txt title="/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
Match User ubuntu
	Banner /home/ubuntu/.ssh/banner
```

Finally, restart your SSH server to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

This will display the contents of the `~/.ssh/banner` file when you SSH into the machine.

```bash
$ ssh ubuntu@my-machine
Welcome to my machine!
```
