Time flies! It's been a month since I last published.

I've been spending a lot of time recently hacking on my configuration setup. 

I've written about [zellij](https://kristianfreeman.com/quick-review-of-zellij/) on this blog in the past, and that was one of the big things that caused me to rethink a lot of my setup. 

The idea is basically "what are the things I take for granted in my setup that have new alternatives?"

Quick list of some of my recent moves:

- Neovim setup: [`nvchad`](https://nvchad.com) => [`kickstart.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
- GitHub Copilot => [Supermaven](https://supermaven.com) (with [`supermaven-nvim`](https://github.com/supermaven-inc/supermaven-nvim))
- `curl`/`http` => [`xh`](https://github.com/ducaale/xh)
- File searching: [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) and [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

`fzf` in particular has been super interesting to me. I suspect if my Unix skills were a bit better, I could pipe all sorts of things into it.

One of my favorite tricks with it is to execute from a series of scripts using `./`, followed by `fzf`'s built-in `<C-t>` command, which is a fuzzy file finder.

Imagine I have a folder `requests`, which contains a collection of scripts. If I type `./`, then press `<C-t>`, I can fuzzy find everything that is a child of the current directory. So I can type `re/` (filter _fuzzily_ down to things inside of `requests/`, and then pick the file I want. The filename is output to the terminal, and since it was prefixed with `./`, I can press enter to execute it. Sweet!
