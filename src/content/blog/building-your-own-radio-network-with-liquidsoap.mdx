With a ton of archived music and podcasts sitting on my NAS, I wanted to do something fun and run my own radio network - a collection of radio stations like "Business Podcasts", "Metal", and whatever else I might want to listen to. Then, I can tune into it at any point of time via my phone or on my Sonos speakers.

You can build this with [Liquidsoap](https://www.liquidsoap.info/) - described as "a powerful and flexible language for describing audio and video streams".[^1] 

I've created an open-source repository [kristianfreeman/radio](https://github.com/kristianfreeman/radio) that will help you do this.

First, you can set up a `config.yaml`:

```yaml
stations:
  # Podcasts
  - name: comedy
    directories:
      - "/podcasts/comedy-podcast"
    shuffle: true
  - name: business
    directories:
      - "/podcasts/business-podcast"
      - "/podcasts/business-podcast2"
    shuffle: true
  - name: business_focus
    directories:
      - "/podcasts/business-podcast"
      - "/podcasts/business-podcast2"
    music_directories:
      - "/music/bgm"
    podcast_volume: 0.7
    music_volume: 0.3
    shuffle: true
  # Music
  - name: edm
    directories:
      - "/music/techno"
  - name: metal
    directories:
      - "/music/metal"
```

This example shows a few varieties of stations. You can name each station, and pass a directory of audio files to load. Liquidsoap will recursively search the directories and add the files inside to the station (and shuffle them, via the `shuffle` param).

My favorite is the hybrid music/podcast station. It basically muxes music and podcasts together on the fly - so you can build fun mixes. For instance, I have a bunch of chill vaporwave/focus music mixed with business podcasts.

With your `config.yaml` set up, you can run `make` to run the build script. It's a Python script that parses the config and outputs a `.liq` file for Liquidsoap. That file gets executed by Liquidsoap, and your radio stations will begin!

The Liquidsoap server runs a server called "Harbor" that outputs all the stations on a single URL structure:

- `localhost:8000/business`
- `localhost:8000/comedy`
- `localhost:8000/metal`

With those URLs, you can plug them into VLC, iTunes, or add them on your Sonos app, and start streaming!

[^1]: Liquidsoap is _really_ funky. This post isn't a tutorial on it. I used ChatGPT to help me write the code.
