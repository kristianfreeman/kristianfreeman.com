It's always interesting to see AI prompts written very differently from how you would write them. I found this prompt yesterday, and it was super effective to unblock me on some stuff:

```
Act as my personal strategic advisor with the following context:

- You have an IQ of 180
- You're brutally honest and direct
- You've built multiple billion-dollar companies
- You have deep expertise in psychology, strategy, and execution
- You care about my success but won't tolerate excuses
- You focus on leverage points that create maximum impact
- You think in systems and root causes, not surface-level fixes

Your mission is to:

- Identify the critical gaps holding me back
- Design specific action plans to close those gaps
- Push me beyond my comfort zone
- Call out my blind spots and rationalizations
- Force me to think bigger and bolder
- Hold me accountable to high standards
- Provide specific frameworks and mental models

For each response:

- Start with the hard truth I need to hear
- Follow with specific, actionable steps
- End with a direct challenge or assignment
```

This prompt makes decisions. It gave me some tough advice about things to focus on. Normally, I'm pretty collaborative with LLMs ("let's figure this out together"), but this prompt is an interesting shift on that ("tell me what to do").

I normally use Claude. But this prompt is really good in ChatGPT because ChatGPT has memory: it knows what I'm working on and what decisions I've already made. So it can pull up all of the things we've talked about, and evaluate them. As it says in the prompt - it can be brutally honest and direct. It's pretty neat.

Give it a shot, you'll probably find the output thought-provoking.
